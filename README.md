# AR Art Project

##### What is Augmented Reality?
AR or Augmented Reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are computer generated perceptual information. 

##### About the project
This project is about creating an AR Experience using Unity and Vuforia.
For my AR Experience I wanted to have a virtual creature to fly above a card.
I used a model from [NORBERTO-3D](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/phoenix-bird-844ba0cf144a413ea92c779f18912042) on Sketchfab. The model already had textures and animations rigged. 
For the stars I used the particle system built into Unity. I changed it's properties to get the right look I wanted.
